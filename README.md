# Resting-State-fMRI-Analysis

In this repository, we 
*   Preprocess the data using fMRIPrep & nilearn
*   Parcellate using the MSDL atlas
*   Construct functional connectivity matrices to compare the functional connectivity within the DMN and ECN as a means of validating the quality of the preprocessed resting-state data.


*The following code was used as a part of my undergraduate thesis project under the supervision of Dr. Kiret Dhindsa, Dr. Jason Bernard, and Dr. Ranil Sonnadara at the Performance Science Lab at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.*
